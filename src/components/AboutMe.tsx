        <p>
          A passionate software developer who specialize in crafting modern web
          applications using modern tech stacks based in Sri Lanka. Outside of
          coding, I explore tech trends, create case studies for client
          projects, and break down complex problems into simple, dev-friendly
          solutions. I'm all about learning fast, building smarter, and growing
          with every line of code.
